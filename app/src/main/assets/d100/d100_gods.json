				"Rymat Samiar – Demigod of bridges, ferryboats, and fjords. Samiar was born a mortal who later achieved great renown for his swordplay, trickery, and legendary ability to escape from the most secure prisons in the multiverse. His most famous exploit was escaping from the afterlife by transforming into a frog and swimming back across the Stream of Life. He tricked the Servitor of Death sent to retrieve him to make a bargain that he would protect others from mishaps when fording the Stream if he could remain free. Now he is invoked by those wishing a safe crossing across rivers and streams. He usually appears as a rapier-wielding bipedal frog.",
				"Ismaros – God of stalking. The hooded figure looks a bit like the grim reaper, but without being a skeleton. He is not very popular, but he is always there, always watching everyone and everything. If you wish to make a deal with him for information, it will come at a great price.",

If done correctly and by the right person the door will materialize and a hearth and bed will be waiting inside the stone.",
				"Fýsi – Goddess of the reclaiming wilds. When disaster strikes a town and buildings or lives are lost, that is the work of Fýsi, she takes back the man-made. Followers of Fýsi are nomadic and travel between villages on the outskirts of the wilds. Followers of Fýsi are not so much protected by her, or sent by her for specific bidding, but rather understand that Fýsi will act and it is a question of disaster, or a safe offering. They understand that Fýsi acts to protect nature and her disasters are akin to the lashing out of a scared animal, when her home is encroached by mankind. Followers are often offered respite in abandoned buildings in the village. Often, disaster can be warded off when followers arrive at the village and suggest safe homes and objects to offer to nature, so that disaster can be averted. Rangers and hunters will seek out these followers for blessing to avoid animal attacks and other dangers of the wild. A common ward is a packet of seeds kept in a cloth pouch with dry earth from their village. As long as the traveler keeps the soil dry, they will be safe.",

				"Amarazen – God of Protection and Life, she is said to be the one that guided [city's founder] to the oasis that made [Desert city] possible. Those who anger her are given visions of water that isn't real. Most claim her essence rests in the oasis and so the largest temple belongs to to her as she allowed them to live at the oasis' side.

				"Falkorta – Goddess of luck – Ironically, she's worshipped by strategists and leaders, who believe chance plays a huge role in any important event. She decides who to give her blessings, and does so to anyone, just to make it look like she's neutral, even though she prefers to bring luck to those who never give up. Usually takes the form of a small pink dragon.",
				"Icholese – The Lady of the Lake, the Teal Stream. Godess of lakes, rivers, and all inland waters. She protects the health of her people by granting them pure water and healings. She can take the form of a great predatory fish or a willow. Her fidels often throw offerings in ponds and ritualistically drown sacrifices",
				"Doran – The God of the Forge. He is a Dwarf with a mighty hammer in hand and towers even Orcs in size. It is said that the unique weapons that Dwarves use come from Doran telling them how to make it when they sleep. These same legends say the weapons are to have a greater purpose in the future against an unknown enemy.",
				"Bob – God of the mundane.",
				"Peolai – Goddess of luck. Big on irony, she tends to make life chaotic for those people most staunchly committed to our ability to control our own destiny. On the other hand, for those who rely upon luck and appease her, their good fortune becomes almost predictable.",
				"Lelia – One of the twin druid gods, Lelia is the opposite of Vadaszat. Called the Mother of Nature, the owl-headed goddess represents life and balance in nature. She and Vadaszat select a shared mortal champion from among their druids, called the Skinwalker.",

				"Aussiria – Goddess to Kobolds, Dragonborn, and other races with draconic heritage. It is said she was born a pure white color, and emanated a powerful good aura unlike her brothers and sisters.

Draconic societies that worship her are therefore very welcoming with their hospitality to outsiders, though they are not against using claw and breath to maintain the sanctity of their homes.",
				"God of the Forgotten – you know how sometimes you wash your laundry and sometimes you end up missing a few socks? They're his now. Orphanages hold a special place in his heart, and any legends, stories, or prophecies lost to time are his to know.",
				"God of Belief – If an “AllFather” or “God of Creation”, or “King of Gods” had an origin story, it would be because of this god. Following through on superstitions (like knocking on wood, or throwing salt over your left shoulder) is worship to him, and as this God is of Belief, he is able to create new Gods–which may or may not be properly thankful for their creation (e.g. “Oh hero, it is because of your belief that I am alive! Here is a boon.”). His true form cannot be seen by anyone, as anyone who sees him sees what they believe he looks like.",
				"Goddess of Choices – Much like her sister the Goddess of Luck, this goddess is more on the “cosmic” scale of things. Able to see other outcomes for different choices–and depending on the outcome of the choice and whether or not you are in her favor, she may let you choose the more fortunate path. Alternatively, if you piss her off, she may send you down the more destructive path–even if it seemingly looks like the best path, at the moment. She is fond of games that require logic or math.",
				"Goddess of Elements – not just of water, nor solely of fire, air, or earth–and certainly not “mother nature”. “Element” golems worship her, as it is she who grants them life. She has a particular fondness of fire and lava–or, really, any of the “heated” elements. Being a high priest in her temple means remaining virginal–she rewards loyalty with immunities.",
				"The Gray God – A solitary genderless god, half pure evil and half pure good, both sides are eternally in pain from the others' existence. Worship at their feet means relief of pain from it's existence, and with relief brings information that Good can use against Evil–as well as information Evil can use against good (both pieces of information are given at the same time to the one worshiping). Also could be considered a god of wealth, the Gray God also finds pain relief in donations of silver coins (melted in sacrifice). The larger the donation, the more your alignment slides towards True Neutral.",
				"Goddess of the Gift – any time something is given selflessly, or out of good will to another is worship to her. Fun fact: any version of “Santa Claus” on any version of reality is her champion. Usually “appears” to those who have great potential but are in dire straits–she isn't ever actually seen, mind you, but something draws her target to whatever gift she's left behind. Typically, her gift is contextual in nature.",
				"The Write/ReWrite God – authors/bards pray to him, their worship is books/songs, his temples are libraries/music halls. This god looks like… well, like a shut-in middle-aged male with a pencil on his ear, glasses down his nose, and rumpled up dark-brown hair with silver streaks on either side. If your adventure, your quest, whatever mission you're on, is not going well… you pray to this god, and hope he doesn't find your story exciting. If your downturn of events makes for a good book, he will ignore you, and may even possibly send more challenges your way; but if you seem unjustly getting the wrong end of the stick (so to speak), he will erase what's happened, and re-write it so you come out better.",
				"Spencer – God of storytelling and beards.",
				"Vance – the god of deceit, mischief, and insanity. Represented by a smiling gray mask. He blesses those who worship him with insanity and power.

He is known to take any bet, whatever the chances.",
				"Judrod – Goddess of lost causes. Taking the form of a brief spark of light, this goddess is known to appear when all seems lost. A flash in the eyes of a sickly child just before a miraculous recovery, a glint off a rock that momentarily blinds an executioner, a meteor in the sky that leads a starving man out of the forest: all these are manifestations of her brief favor. Impossible to prove from mere coincidence, her boons are nonetheless real.",
				"Paxe – the god of peaceful passings. Taking the form of a kindly stranger, this god will appear at the side of those dying in pain or in fear and will comfort them until they claimed by Death. Paxe will grant blessings on those that nurse the sick or comfort the troubled. Necromancers and torturers earn the god's wrath, as Paxe will reveal in harsh detail to them how they will die.",
				"Fortuna – goddess of luck and gambling that celebrates fair play. She will never alter the outcome of a game of chance, but will often grant boons to those that willingly risk everything. Appearing as a smiling beauty with fire red hair, she might gift a gracious loser at a casino with a priceless ruby or a winner at a card game with a passionate kiss. Those that cheat at games of chance, though, earn her wrath and instead see her moments before meeting a grusome end in a random accident.",
				"Azuiar – Secret god of preservation. On the surface, Azuiar is a god of evil, the proverbial devil on your shoulder convincing you to do bad things. In reality he chose to adopt the mantle of the evil god out of fear that the world was changing too drastically toward good. Azuiar is the god of all who wish to corrupt and do evil for its own sake.",
				"Entaros – God of the Soil- A massive giant ridden with dirt, grass, and plant life. Many say he is made of stone himself, with a heart of diamond.

He rests in the earth, appearing to be a huge overgrown mountain. Many druids and those who respect nature are his followers.",

				"Nurggle – God of the unclean. Nurggle thrives on the rot and decay of all things as he and his followers see it being the common denominator of everything. Nurggles avatar is the form of a Giant/Orc hybrid with the broken antlers of an elk. He wishes for the decay of not just physical entities but also society, love/purity in relationships, and advancement. His followers often douse townsfolk with their chamberpots and exhume corpses in the name of Nurggle. Nurggle only appears to mortals when they have destroyed or desecrated something of great sentimental worth, when he reveals himself he will complete one task for a mortal so long as it is vile and distasteful. No Lawful or good alignments would worship this deity.",

				"Perthor – A semi-humanoid man in ragged clothes and a wide-brimmed hat. 17 feet tall and extremely thin, his body appears to be made of very old wood and he is covered in moss and other plant life. His head is a ball of shadows with two glowing yellow eyes. God of life, death and the natural order, patron to all druids and enemy of all necromancers. He is totally unwavering and infalible, acting as gatekeeper to the underworld and as a symbol of the inevitability and finality of death.

				"Araknev – scorpion god of darkness, trickery and deceit. Araknev is an ageless alien entity drawn by great shifts in power or promising evil presences in the multiverse. He is charismatic and manipulative, and seeks to shape all reality in his fiendish, twisted image. His followers turn on their former allied overnight, betraying their way to power and wealth.",
				"Israfiel – God of Angels. A former Solar, Israfiel generated enough of a following on his own to be revered as a god among angels. While not particularly well-known on the material plane, Israfiel's domains include the upper planes and ascension, making him the patron of those who wish to serve in the heavens when they die. He is a paragon of lawful good to such an extent that he's seen by those that know him as a metaphysical constant that helps define what it means to be 'good'.",
				"Jack – God of Deals. 'Jack' goes by many names to many different people but most often introduces himself as 'Jack' to people meeting him for the first time. While he is a devil god of immense power, Jack is bound by only being able to effect what others allow him to. He authors and abides by countless deals and contracts with mortals in order to spread his influence and power and open up more avenues to actually exert his strength. For a devil, he is surprisingly open about his motives and speaks plainly about what he offers to others and why. He appears to mortals as an unassuming-looking human or elven man wearing impeccable clothing and is courteous, often greeting people with the line, “Pleased to meet you,” and describing himself as, “A man of wealth and taste.” Lawful evil.",
				"Myshta – God of X Forest. A lesser god, not even truly considered one by some scholars, Myshta is a god whose domain is local to and entirely contained within a single forest. Within her forest, she is an intellectus (localized omniscience) and can see, hear and understand that state of anything that calls her forest home. She wills her forest to grow and spread and doesn't take issue with creatures living within her forest but can be aggressive and vengeful towards those who threaten the lives of the plants and creatures that make up her domain. True neutral.",
				"Sedyne – God of Brawlers. An ascended mortal of ages past, Sedyne was well-known for being a remarkable fighter long before her ascension to godhood. Now she encourages aggression, violence and combativeness among her followers. She is that patron that pit fighters and brawlers will pray to for the stamina to go one more round or the strength to deliver a debilitating blow. Chaotic, impartial to good/evil.",

Garbed in robes made from the soft golden glow of dawn, she embodies the spirit of renewal and rebirth; a belief that something beautiful will always come, no matter the bleakness of what comes before.

				"Issha, who stands against the storm – Despite being a storm deity, Issha does not control the storm. The force of weather is a force too massive and too chaotic to be controlled. Rather, it is Issha's job to fight and hold back the destructive power of the storm, because left unchecked, it would render the world barren and uninhabitable. Issha is a lawful good tempest deity.

				"Remira – the God of Light burns all unworthy to his eye with his magnificent gaze. Those worthy of his regard are heroes of virtue, beings of honour and glory. The worthiest are his Paladins and those giving their life to protect the innocent, the righteous and honorable!",
				"Olkath and Althok – the Twins of Life and Death; one wrapped in blooming vines and accompanied by merry laughter, the other always halfway hidden in shadows and killing everything he touches. The brothers are as contrary as fire and water, black and white, light and dark; their clergies split as well, although Life is meaningless without Death and Death is not without Life.",
				"Kinfal – Daughter of Smoke, Mistress of Flame, Goddess of Fire. She is chaotic and merciless, gives and takes life in equal measure. She is said to favour smiths even above her own clergy and sailors use her name when cursing enemy ships and crews.",
				"Plera – the Black Elk: Goddess of the Forest, gracious to those who respect her domains and creations, patron of hunters, druids and rangers. Might bless one by appearing in the form of a black moose on a forest clearing; one will be granted safe passage through her domain without needing to worry for food and water.",
				"Natuno – God of Mistakes. Her goal is to keep everyone just out of reach of their full potential. For every missed note a bard plays, every hunt a ranger loses track of, and every botched experiment a wizard creates, Natuno is there watching and guiding them away from success.",
				"Zobober – god of spirits and spirits. An orc who ascended to godhood, the priesthood's practices and philosophies include a lot of communion with nature spirits, self-improvement, and regular intoxication through rigorous alcohol consumption.",
				"Bleigusblonde – a vampire god of nurturing. He grants strength and wisdom to vampire children who worship him by carrying a beige string and a small pebble in their pockets",
				"Toam'aron – God of tactics and battlefield strategy. He helps his followers see into the tactics of their enemy and place themselves to fight the easier battle. Encourages laziness and letting the enemy overwork themselves to fight you rather than go to fight the enemy, making the fight more unfair.",
				"Seva – goddess of the sands. She takes the form of a large serpent, spends her days sleeping under the sand dunes and the nights rearranging her expansive deserts."
