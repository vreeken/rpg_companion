When you finally reeled it in you found a gold ring, but the gold was almost blood red, and in you hand it felt like it had almost no weight. Your crew members wanted to see the ring, but they only saw it as normal gold, you saw it for something much more incredible. When they tried to take it from you you flew into a rage beating them senseless until you jumped into a rowboat and made your way back to shore. You know that they will probably come after you, but none of that matters, you know that you must go to the mountains. You just don’t know where or what a mountain is.",

Not knowing any better, you became strong with a smile. One evening, you showed kindness to an old woman who turned out to be a fairy queen in disguise. She blessed you with intelligence. Disgusted with the way you were treated, you left home, hoping to learn to read, study, and start life anew.",

You walked away and now are trying to find your place in the world.",
				"For your entire life up to now you have watched others perform magic, they were few, but fantastical and filled your heart with wonder.

One day, you hit your head on a rock. When you next awoke, you were in leather armor, on a sailing ship as part of an adventuring party. An entire life of adventure, riches, and excitement unfolded, and as you lay down for the last time, surrounded by your allies and loved ones, you woke back up with a pain in your temple, 3 seconds after hitting your head.

For years you served, learning the ins and outs of the physical and spiritual side of dealing with death. You learned about your god, the patron of death, from the gravedigger, but his worship always seemed a bit hollow, a little too rote. One night you picked up the sacred text he kept on the small shrine in your shared chambers and read it. You became shocked and dismayed at the disparity between the soft platitudes your guardian parrots and the dire truths uncovered in your god’s scriptures.

They, and you once you were old enough, provided services such as greeting guests, expelling uninvited intruders, maintaining inventory, cleaning, and cooking fine meals. You have fond memories of playing in a piles of gold, stirring a 2000 gallon stew pot, donning magic clothing and weapons, leafing through esoteric books of powerful magic to look at the pictures, and attempting to outwit your draconic landlord with whatever puzzles and games you could think of. You left on good terms at the same time the dragon’s youngling left to establish its own territory, and you hope to carve out a bit of the world for yourself as well.",

You ran a lot of errands, being tolerant of sunlight and unlikely to send the whole town fleeing for the hills. Your main mentor was a flamboyant skeleton with a hat of disguise and a penchant for long-winded but thrilling tales of ages past. Armed with ancient weapons, some minor alchemy materials, the lost necromancer’s notes, and the skills your undead family taught you, you now walk the earth. You are quite open-minded about creatures of the dark and undeath, but having seen the goodness they are capable of, you are intolerant of undead who would exist at the expense of others and visit cruelty on the living.",
				"You were born into a clan that viewed those born with magical power as evil. During your coming of age ceremony your powers awakened and you found yourself surrounded in arcane power. Fearful of you, the clan leader cast you out. Now you roam as an exile from your clan trying to understand your powers.",

				"You don’t remember your father at all, but your mother says that they were the most handsome and talented bard in all the land. Each day you wonder what adventures he must be on, as your village has nothing for you but chickens to pluck and hogs to hang. With nothing but pitchfork and hoe in hand you set out, determined to find your father, or at least bring back a story for the folks back home.",
				"Your father was a blacksmith, but he’s not truly your father. Your mother cheated on him years ago and he knows it. Whether it’s true or not you’ll never know. He hates you for it nonetheless.

				"When you were young, you had a thing for fire. It was pretty, destructive, and alluring. One night as your family slept you were playing with it and accidentally set the family home ablaze. Your mother awoke to the inferno and using every once of power she had saved you from the blaze before succumbing and burning up right in front of your eyes. It was the most beautiful thing you ever saw, and if only the world understood, then maybe they wouldn’t be so afraid of fire.",

				"You are … were a member of the city watch. Now, you suppose that you’ve likely lost that position. Just like your father, you were signed up and joined their ranks at quite a young age. You were far too low of a rank to call your job fulfilling or exciting, but you didn’t really mind it all that much. After work you’d spend about half a day’s pay drowning your boredom in booze. You’ve always had a love for a good brew, but you never thought it much of a problem. Until recently. It seems one night you decided to go on a week long binge. What few memories you have are too fuzzy and disorienting to make any sense of. How you’re alive, you don’t know. During your blackout, you seem to have somehow made it to somewhere you don’t even recognize. You’re wearing equipment you don’t remember acquiring. You accidentally set off a cantrip, despite the fact you’ve never even seen magic at work, let alone use it. Some guy just told you that you asked him to get you up so you could go meet with someone about a new job. You decide that you need to figure out what happened and that maybe you really do have a drinking problem.",
				"You grew up alone in a rather large and well kept house, no parents that you can remember, or relatives you visited, but food would always appear out of nowhere in the pantry, as did gold in the sofa and water in the well. One day, you woke up on the ground, the house having completely disappeared from existence. In its place, a note remained, reading ‘Stay Strong!’ Of course, you began adventuring from there.",

				"You were born in a tribe of nomadic people. In your young age you and your parents got captured in a raid and sold as slaves. Your family got lucky because you have been sold to a noble. His castle was in a cold region with hard winters. He was a brutal leader but fair to everybody who did as he told. You learned the etiquette of the royal court and got along very well. As you became an adult he gave you to another lord to become a soldier. Their kingdom was at war. On the way to your new owner your caravan got raided by their enemy. You somehow escaped. A few days later you found out that your former lord has been attacked and everyone including your parents were murdered. You left the kingdom and never came back till today.",

				"Raised by pirates you raided the wrong temple and you were the sole surviver.",
				"Raised by ogres they always threatened to eat you growing up. You payed them tribute and grew above the goblin ranks. Eventually you made your bid for freedom by poisoning all their dinner. You are a legend amongst the goblins and ogres.",
				"You had a normal childhood in the city. Schooling, family, friends, playing on the large stone walls…but all that was taken away in an instant when 200 hollow-core Warforged self destructed… leveling the city you once called home.
