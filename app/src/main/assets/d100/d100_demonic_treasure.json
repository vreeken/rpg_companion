				"Flask of the Old Horned One: Originally used to trap two escaped high devils, this flask can hold up to three souls comfortably for transport.",
				"Rottskiff of the Rhymers: An iron spike with a red glowing sigil at the top. Plunge the spike into a corpse and throw it in a body of water or lava and have an Infernal boat rise up within minutes from the bubbling vis. Retrieving the spike from the ship wheel returns the boat to Hell.",
				"Two knuckledusters made of human jaws, but with the teeth all still attached at unnatural angles.",
				"Crown of Forgotten Sacrament – piece of headgear made from solid burnt-like metal of unknown origin. Worn by powerful demonic entity from the world before ours. Although much of its power was lost, it allows its wearer to jump between material world and Secret Plane of Black Fire, a place of torture and home of the oldest demons. It also empowers any ritual for creating bonds and pacts with lesser demons.",
				"The Devourer’s Maw – a large pale helmet made of the teeth of large beasts, which slowly shifts across the surface aimlessly. When worn, the wearer can focus to form a mouth with said teeth, consuming all in range. If worn for too long or used too often, causes teeth to sprout across the skin, which slowly forms chattering mouths.",
				"The Glutton’s Harvest – a large scythe with a fleshy, dark red handle, and a blade made of a large jaw, lined with incisors. When attacking an organic foe, all damage heals the wielder, with an amputations or removal of chunks of flesh providing overheal. When attacking a construct, causes wielder to violently vomit out matter similar to what makes up said construct.",
				"The Flesh Grinder was born in the bowels of the Abyss, fashioned by demonic hands and infused with all the hate, bile, and violence bubbling up from that dire realm. The Flesh Grinder has the general size and shape of a great sword, but in place of a smooth cutting edge, it has a toothy row of jagged barbs. Old blood mixed with dark grease oozes from the barbs, and when the weapon is swung in battle, the serrated edge rocks back and forth to chew through flesh and bone, spewing noxious smoke into the air. A horrific weapon created from nightmare, a Flesh Grinder is alive with malevolence, filled with an unspeakable thirst for blood and flesh. Mechanically it’s a +2 Great sword; once per day, on a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take an additional 2d6 slashing damage. On a critical hit, these dice are also doubled.",
				"Hellfire: A beautiful ebony dagger that pulses with infernal energy and deals an additional 1d6 fire & necrotic damage. All demons recognize this blade.",
				"Brimstone: A twin to Hellfire this beautiful ebony dagger pulses with infernal energy and deals an additional 1d6 fire & necrotic damage.",

				"Coin of Combustion: A typical coin only distinguishable by the permanent scorch marks on either side. If placed in a coin purse the purse becomes cursed. Any time a creature attempts to use coins from inside they are greeted by a handful of red-hot coins and take 2d8 fire damage. If the creature wishes to maintain a hold on the coins they must succeed a constitution saving throw or drop the coins back into the purse. If they succeed on the save and remove the coins from the purse they instantly return to normal. If coins are poured from the bag they glow red-hot and cannot be extinguished for 1 minute and will set anything flammable that they touch on fire.",
				"Mouth of the mindless. Hollowed out demons horn that when blown into makes people with low intelligence a mindless slave for an hour.",
				"Torturer’s Payslips: a stack of thin, note-card sizes slips of paper. The paper can be written on as normal, but when the opposite side is pressed against organic material, the paper crumbles away leaving behind the contents of the note burnt into the surface.",
				"Death-stroke Talisman: a fist size clump of hairy scalp wrapped in barbed wire dangling on a length of scarlet silk. When the wearer confirms a critical hit on an enemy, that creature is now stunned for 1d4 rounds and may chatter fearfully about the ringing of a distant bell.",
				"Cobraphone: a reeded stem attached to a compressible air bladed made from the skin of several reptiles. When played, nearby snakes seem to be drawn to the haunting drone.",
				"Putrid Silver: a tainted ore found in caverns where demonic presences used to reside… or perhaps still do. The metal can be forged and crafted into armor and weapons, but it seems to leak odorous black oil. When cracked or broken, the material will slowly repair itself over time.",
				"Visage of Avorice: a bizarre helm made from countless brass coils that strangely do not protect the wearer’s mouth. When worn, the player receives Deathwatch as a passive ability and can learn the hit points of an adjacent creature a number of times a day equal to her Wisdom modifier (similar to combat awareness). If the player delivers a killing blow on anything while the Visage of Avorice is being worn, roll a DC 15 Will save. Failure results in the uncontrollable urge to consume the flesh of her victim.",
				"Sharpening Stone – It appears to be a sharpening stone made of some substance the color of dried blood. People who sharpen edged weapons on it hear what sounds like an army of insect voices calling for blood and vengeance, no one else hears anything. Edged weapons sharpened on the stone produce wounds that bleed freely and heal slowly if at all. Any blade sharpened on the stone will turn against its owner at a time of great need.",
				"Six’s Sixgun – An old style single action pistol with grips made of human bone, all the metal in its construction is black, pitted, and marked with dull red flecks. The first five of the bullets in the gun will always strike any target within 20 meters regardless of the skill of the user or the direction the gun is pointed. They will ricochet off objects or even curve their own path to strike and slay whoever the shooter wills. One shot, one kill, always. The sixth bullet will always strike and slay the shooter or someone the shooter loves. Once fired Six’s Sixgun cannot be lost, stolen, dropped, sold, or otherwise transferred. Any attempt to use a different gun will, somehow, result in Six’s Sixgun being in the shooter’s hand instead. Though rumors abound of ways to break the curse, none have ever worked.",
				"Bag of Luck – A seemingly ordinary leather bag with no markings or sinister aura whatsoever. It is secured by a thong long enough to go over a person’s head, and will not open until someone places the thong around their neck. Inside the Bag of Luck are 24 pearlescent beads that smell delicious and seem almost to glow with their own light. Each bead is exactly one hour of luck, 12 good, 12 bad. There is no way to determine which is which without eating it and activating it. When under the effect of a good luck bead the user cannot fail in anything involving an element of luck. In game terms, every single die roll the user makes will be a critical success. When under the effects of a bad luck bead the user cannot succeed in anything involving an element of luck. In game terms every single die roll will be a critical failure. Any attempt to use logic or trickery to determine which beads are which by, for example taking one bead and seeing that it was bad luck and then eating all the remaining 23 on the theory that the good luck will counterbalance the bad luck, will backfire. In that example what the user took for bad luck initially will all turn out to have long term positive effects and taking all the remaining beads will result in catastrophe and possibly death from ill fortune. The bag cannot be taken from the user’s neck until all beads are eaten. Any attempt to remove the bag before then will result in the bag tightening around the user’s neck and strangling them until they stop trying to remove it. If the beads are not all used within 72 hours the bag will strangle and kill the user. Do you feel lucky?",
				"The Essay of Eris – A seemingly ordinary sheet of paper or parchment. Anyone reading it will see believable, plausible, and totally false, evidence that those closest to them are conspiring against them to kill or enslave them or worse. The contents may appear to be a personal letter from one person to another, a report from a rival agency, or whatever else would be most likely to cause the reader to think their friends or allies had betrayed them. There is no magic coercion; the reaction of the reader is entirely a matter of how paranoid they are. A normal person with no reason to think they have enemies it might dismiss its claims entirely. But if put into a delicate situation where betrayal is likely it can cause civil wars, bring down spy agencies, and turn a room of distrustful conspirators into a howling mob with each person seeking to kill all the others.",
				"Eyespikes of Sithrax – Two iron spikes with stains from old blood. When driven into the eyes of a victim with a hammer, killing the victim they will ignite and over the course of ten minutes all flesh will burn from the victim’s skull. It is now a Burning Skull of Sithrax and is continuously aflame about as hot as a normal fireplace fire. The Burning Skull of Sithrax will answer four questions 100% accurately, 100% honestly, and as unhelpfully as possible. When not answering questions the Burning Skull of Sithrax screams curses, threats, and describes in horrifying detail the tortures that Sithrax will inflict on all in earshot. After the fourth question is asked and answered the Burning Skull of Sithrax will consume itself and turn to ash after ten minutes of screaming the deepest and darkest secrets of the last person to ask it a question to anyone who can hear. Afterward the Eyespikes of Sithrax revert to their inert state and can be driven into the eyes of another victim.",
				"Siphon of Asmodeus – A gleaming silver chain about three feet long with a golden disk on one end and a copper disk on the other. It allows the person holding the golden disk to transfer injury, age, illness, tiredness, or any other negative condition to the person touching the copper disk. Any injury, regardless of severity or age, can be transferred. A person missing an arm could transfer that to the person on the copper end causing the victim to lose their arm while the person holding the gold disk regained their arm. Given a supply of victims a person with the Siphon of Asmodeus could theoretically live forever, in perpetual youth and perfect health. The most insidious aspect of the Siphon is that there are no downsides at all to the person benefiting. Their health is not creepy; their youth is not waxy. Using the Siphon is not painful to either the victim or the user, though obviously the victim may feel pain from whatever injuries or age are transferred to them. This, of course, encourages the owner to use it and by doing so spread misery and damn themselves.",
				"Demonbone Bow – The Demonbone Bow was crafted by the Church of Heavenly Light, a sect of fanatic demon hunting crusaders who believed that the ends justify the means and that demons deserved whatever fate they got. Made from bones and sinew extracted from a dozen living demons flayed and suspended from blessed chains while the Church did its grisly work. The bow is a weapon made specifically to kill demons, and it does the job quite well. Even when normal arrows are shot from the bow it does quadruple damage to demons, and when using arrows made from demon bone it will slay any common demon with a single hit, and do ten times normal damage even to demon lords. Those who use the bow become sadistic, careless ending of life in the name of their cause, and soon seek only the most brutal and agonizing means of achieving their goals. Whether this is due to the corrupting influence of the material from which the bow is made, or from the zealotry that went into its construction is an open question.",
				"The Tongue of Beelzebub – Appearing as a desiccated human tongue, if a sufficiently devoted (or deranged) person cuts out their own tongue and replaces it with the Tongue of Beelzebub the tongue will become living and work like a normal tongue. Once installed the Tongue of Beelzebub allows the user to lie perfectly. The user gains a large bonus to any skill related to lying, conning, deceit or any other illicit act involving speech. Lying becomes so natural, so second nature, to the user that within a week they must make an effort of will to tell the truth in any situation (in game terms, they need to pass a Will check that becomes increasingly difficult with each month of use). The user also gains an insatiable thirst for human blood, needing to drink the final drops of blood from the heart of a debauched liar, drunkard, or other sinful person every two weeks or they will begin to suffer effects identical to dying of thirst and will, in fact, die after two weeks and three days without blood. There is no way to get the necessary blood without killing a ‘sinful’ person. After one year of use, the person cannot speak the truth under any circumstances at all and loses the ability to discern reality from fantasy or truth from lies. They say whatever they think will benefit them the most in that moment with no regard at all for its truth or falsehood and those who hear them speak tend to believe them even if they contradict themselves. After two years of use the person tells lies to themselves, believing themselves to be the greatest, the best, the most amazing, and their ego grows to make them incapable of believing that anyone can do anything at all better than them. Most users die shortly after this, having convinced themselves that they can fly, or that they can defeat a giant in single combat, or other deadly tasks. The Tongue is currently held by a group of Beelzebub cultists who worship its user as the voice of Beelzebub on Earth and believe that the truth of the cosmos and other great things can be discerned from the lies if only one is clever enough to do so. Despite the fact that most who use the Tongue die after only two years there is always great competition among the devotees of Beelzebub to become its next bearer.",
				"Apple of Doubt: it looks like an apple, it tastes like an apple, it smells like an apple, for all intents and purposes it appears to be an apple, but you are certain it is not an apple.",

				"Thrice-Cursed Bloodsilver Claw – Made by a demon lord as a weapon against devils. It radiates demonic energy. The silver, mixed with the demon’s own blood, make these claws deadly to devils and it can nullify any resistances that even the most powerful of devils has, unless they are also divine (cough Asmodeus cough), since their divinity would also protect them. Take note, however, that this was made by demons for demons, and radiates enough demonic energy to deal 1d6 necrotic damage per round to the mortal using this if they fail a DC 15 Con Save.",
				"Hellforged Cold Iron Great sword – Made by a powerful devil as a weapon against demons. It radiates diabolic energy. The cold iron, coated with brimstone and crafted with obsidian, makes the sword deadly to even the most resilient demon, and can cut even through any resistances that the demon may have, unless they also have divinity somehow, because that would also protect them. Take note, however, that his was made by devils for devils, and the diabolic energy it contains deals 1d6 necrotic damage per round to any mortal using this if they fail a DC 15 Con Save.",
				"The Mirror of Necrotic Future: A mirror with an onyx frame that shows the dead version of characters and things. Must make a saving throw or gain madness.",
				"Relic of St. Crowley: Only four known preserved body parts of this powerful warlock are known to survive. They are known to make infernal beings immune to radiant damage and other beings resistant to magical damage.",

				"The Pawful Trinket: A small marble totem of a sitting cat. When activated (with a word that becomes known to the user after attunement), the person who currently possesses the totem becomes more fascinated and protective of the totem over time. In a day, the person is distracted enough by it to take disadvantage on perception checks. In a week, they have turned inward, devoting their time to playing with it as a cat would a favored plaything, to the exclusion of all else. In a month, if a person tracks the totem to the last known location of the possessor, they will instead find two trinkets. The first day’s effect can be broken by making a will save with disadvantage after one day, the first weeks effect with a will save and forced separation from the object for one week. Deactivating the totem by speaking the word is only effective until the end of the month the totem is given to the possessor.",
				"The Devils Shotglass: when used, the user gains the ability to speak and comprehend infernal for one hour, once per day. If it is used three times, the user’s teeth become sharp, and their tongue forks like a snake.",
				"Barb-and-queued chips: A packet of barbequed chips. If eaten, the user gains a foul odor of sulfur for one day. If chips are crushed by hand and tossed on the ground (a 5×5 ft area), the chips are treated as spiked, barbequed flavored caltrops.",
				"Imp’s Handshake: a sealing ring, with the image of a smiling, winking imp. If the seal is turned inwards towards the palm, the ring can be used to deal 1d4 fire damage and 1d4 necrotic damage as a touch attack once per day. The finger it is worn on is red and blistered after use until the ring is removed, or a long rest is taken.",
				"Hex Appeal: This small marble banana token can be identified to bestow a +1 bonus to charisma checks for the owner. If it is ever put into the user’s pocket, it cannot be removed from that pocket. The banana token then grows to the size of a normal banana, and the pants’ wearer gains disadvantage on acrobatics checks, and advantage on persuasion checks.",
				"A heavy glove made of the leathery skin of some kind of slimy humanoid. The glove acts as a layer of lead, protecting the wearer’s hand from any radiation and from the unstable energy emitted by certain demonic artifacts.",
				"Dagger of the Masochist. +1 weapon that does up to an extra 3d6 necrotic damage if the wielder agrees to take the damage from the attack as well.",
				"Cursed Bag of Holding: The bag acts like a normal bag of holding, but contents are transported to a demon’s lair instead of a pocket dimension. The demon will randomly curse/enhance magical items to malfunction at the DM’s discretion. Upon discovery of its true nature, the party can enter the bag to fight the demon if they desire.",
				"Yeenoghu’s Amulet of Screams: An amulet in the shape of an open mouth. Gives +5 AC, but constantly screams. Unaffected by spells or effects that would silence it.",
				"Fraz-Urb’luu’s Tome of Secrets: Speak a name, and the tome will provide a fact and a lie about the person without differentiating which is which. Repeated uses of the same name have an increased chance to provide two lies.",

As an action, the wearer may cause a creature within 120 feet to be wreathed in dark flame, forcing them to make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw as the heat scorches both their body and soul.
