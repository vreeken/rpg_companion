He uses his ability to bind his fate to a random innocent. Whenever he receives damage, all damage that is done to him is also done to the innocent victim.

They can only be identified as a jumble of rhythms and syllables with seemingly no meaning.

For every soul she devours, she grows a little larger, and an additional mouth appears somewhere on her body.",

Those that cross paths with her are quickly swallowed by her umbral maw and drained of whatever life energy sustains them. Many believe Sohmbraw greedily collects this energy as light, somewhere within the expanse of her domain, but the reason why is yet unknown. The most popular belief is that when bathed in the light of the living, wherever this may be, her umbral form is shed to reveal the person she used to be - the former queen of what is now the Lightless Halls.",
				"MALBRIS - He Who Corrupts and Wears White; Demon Lord of Voluntary Moral Failure: Perpetually masquerading as white-clad figures of goodness, purity, or innocence, Malbris is a sinful chameleon that craves watching the righteous fall from grace.

And once he has pulled them in, he relishes in the life-shattering moment of revelation when a good person sees who they have become. Notably, he never forces or manipulates the victim in any way beyond his natural guile, for he wants the victim to be the cause of their own failure, to have no one else to blame. As such, his machinations are often slow and patient and committed."
