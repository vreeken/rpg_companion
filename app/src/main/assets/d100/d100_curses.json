				"Roll a d8 to determine which cursed Sin takes hold; 1 is Lust, 2 is Gluttony, 3 is Greed, 4 is Sloth, 5 is Wrath, 6 is Envy, and 7 is Pride.

If the person that is the subject of the curse's induced hallucinations engages the afflicted in dialogue, additional hallucinations occur.  The afflicted perceives their teeth and hair falling out and turning to dust, and also their eyes bleeding.  10 minutes after the subject of the hallucinations leaves the targets presence and line of sight, the hallucinations can start again on another person.

Also it turns out that no number of wipes is enough after using a latrine - a thin brown film is visible unless you bathe thoroughly. To appear completely invisible requires a haircut, and approximately three hours of shaving body hair and scrubbing your skin raw. And even then, dirt sticks to your feet immediately.
