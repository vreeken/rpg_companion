				"The Trickster God’s Blessing: This porcelain jester mask is simple, and merely has an unsettling smile carved in. The eyes show the same glee that a child shows as they burn ants with a piece of glass, not fully grasping the value of life. This mask compels to wearer to tell jokes and play tricks. Often times they are twisted ones. The wearer also gains inspiration for successfully tricking, riddling, or pranking others as well as for killing. This effect stacks.

When worn at night or underground, imposed disadvantage on attacker).",
				"Mask of Brutality – This mask resembles a growling devil’s face shaped from a single piece of a dark grey metal, save that the eyes and mouth are covered by bars like a prison cell. The mask, when put on, immediately deals 1d8 damage to the wearer as sharp needles pierce the skull and begin pumping a potent alchemical mixture of growth hormones and other substances into the cranial cavity, fiendish in nature. 2d6 rounds afterwards, the wearer gains a +5 boost to STR as their muscles bulge and swell, and their bones thicken. However, the mixture introduced into the wearer’s body results in an equal penalty to INT, reducing the wearer to a drooling, beastly hulk. Removing the mask deals 2d8 damage to the wearer as the needles tear free of the skull; the effects of the mask wear off after a long rest.",

The mask itself is seemingly unremarkable, a multi coloured mask which looks like it was made of paper mache by a child, and painted haphazardly. However, when worn, the wearer will come into contact with a power being that will grant any one wish to the wearer.

When worn,anyone who makes eye contact with the mask is unable to break eye contact, while no matter which direction they look at the mask from, it looks like they are still making eye contact. While eye contact is being made, all staring will have to make a roll to stop looking, with failed rolls causing them to be unable to do anything. User can cause the mask to ‘blink’, even though the mask lacks an eyelid, breaking eye contact with everyone, but stunning them for a round.",
				"Mask of the Forgotten Friend: A featureless mask, similar in colour to pale skin. Has no hole for eyes, nose or mouth, but allows the user to function as if not wearing a mask at all when worn. While it is worn, all but the strongest of minds will perceive the wearer as a friend or close one, but anyone who knew the wearer before would have no memory of them, simply knowing them as a friend.

The face on the mask is stern and emotionally neutral, with sharp red lines accenting the hard edges and sweeping curves of the otherwise bland white face piece. While the mask is being worn by it’s bound owner, they are able to see through the covered eyes of the mask. The owner is able to detect a consciously made lie made in their presence, though lies made unknowingly and lies of omission are not detected in this way. If the bound owner asks a direct question to a single creature, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 8 + the owner’s proficiency modifier + the owner’s Wisdom modifier or be compelled to truthfully answer the question to the best of their knowledge. In addition, the wearer of the mask is unable to knowingly speak a lie, directly or through omission. The supernatural properties of the mask can only be used by a single person, someone who had a part of their face removed and used in the making of the mask. A part can take the form of a small chunk of skin and flesh, a few teeth, or even a nose or an eye. The part is mixed into the mask, binding the article to the donator and making it so that the power of the mask can only be used by them. Upon the bound owner’s death, the magic is severed and mask becomes a normal face piece.",
				"Face of the Harvester: A delicate clay mask without holes, shaped in such a way that it requires no straps in order to be worn.

The owner is able to identify and harvest plants with greater clarity and efficiency, giving the wearer advantage and doubling their proficiency modifier on Nature and Survival ability checks to understand and collect vegetation, so long as the wearer has proficiency in that skill. If the wearer does not have proficiency in one or both of the skills, they do not benefit from the mask’s bonus to that particular skill. In addition, the bound owner is more likely to receive a fruitful harvest while wearing the mask. If the bound owner harvests a plant while wearing the mask, the freshness and potency of the plant is extended for one and a half times the duration it would otherwise last. If the owner has actively and personally cultivated the growth of the plant, the freshness and potency of the plant is instead extended for twice its original duration.

A part can take the form of a small chunk of skin and flesh, a few teeth, or even a nose or an eye. The part is mixed into the mask, binding the article to the donator and making it so that the power of the mask can only be used by them. Upon the bound owner’s death, the magic is severed and mask becomes a normal face piece.",
				"Le Masque Noirci: This wooden mask covers the upper half of the face and has a few shallow scratches over the left eye that cannot be removed or fixed, no matter who or what tries to fix it. The mask was most likely originally stained either jet black or a dark purple, but the color has faded over time. While worn, the owner cannot discern between different colors, seeing the world only in shades of black and white. That said, they receive an empowered darkvision that can pierce through even magical darkness, even if things can only be seen in black and white. Said darkvision extends out to 60 ft., but if the wearer possesses normal darkvision that extends farther, the effects will carry out to that distance. If the wearer of the mask attempts to look directly at anything emitting a light, they will suffer from temporary blindness that lasts for 15 to 30 seconds as a result. According to an old journal entry found with the mask, repeated attempts to look at light sources will increase the blindness time exponentially, to the point where the effect is permanent.",
				"Face of the Terrified: A papier-mâché mask, vaguely resembling the face of a wide-eyed screaming humanoid. To work properly, this mask must be bound to over the course of a day, worn 24 hours by the desired owner. While the mask is being worn by an unbound owner, they find average things frightening and receive disadvantage on saving throws against the Frightened status. While the mask is being worn by a bound owner, they are instilled with a strange sense of courage, receiving advantage on saving throws against the Frightened status.

				"Mask of the Hanged Man: A burlap sack around which hangs a noose. Upon putting on the mask, the rope tightens considerably, though not enough to choke the wearer. The fabric is ordinary sackcloth with a pair of scant eyeholes crudely torn into the front. The wearer must succeed in a DC15 Will save or become overcome with despair, suffering disadvantage on skill checks. Wearer can command the rope to attempt to grapple foes with advantage as a bonus action. Long term exposure to the mask causes 1d6 psychic damage per hour. Upon reaching 0 from this damage, the wearer simply becomes comatose, unwilling to move or take any action. Removal of the mask requires a will save of 15. This rough sack was the last thing that some condemned soul saw. As it hung with the recently dead, keeping them company as the carrion birds found them, it absorbed some malign energy.",

				"The Planar Visor – An obsidian mask with diamonds worth 100 gp each in the eye sockets. Wearing the mask and speaking the name of a plane of existence will allow the wearer to see into that plane through the eyes of the mask for 2d4 hours.
