				"The Flaming Dragon – A spicy beer that causes the user to breathe fire when they burp.",
				"The Banshee’s Breath – white, swirling liquor made from a special translucent wild berry. Tastes sweet, has an effect similar to mint gum in that it always feels cold.",
				"The Mountain’s Bounty – A fine liquor made using water from a glacial stream. Always refreshing, and always makes you feel cold no mater the weather.",
				"Mawxie – A drink all the locals cite as a local treasure. Tastes disgusting.",
				"Bog Grog – A mix of Rum, Orange Juice and fermented herbs that, when drunk, causes the user to gain advantage on saving throws against being poisoned for 30 minutes.",
				"Frost Mead – Honey and the tear of an Ice Giant make this shot. The crackling blue sparkle and the jet of icy breath you have for rest of the day is worth the expense.",
				"Weatherbee’s Whirler – Invented by the perhaps too inventive Filbus Weatherbee, this drink is testimony as to why it is a bad idea to point a gnome’s sharp mind towards the creation of a new brew. After spending many years living among the dwarves, Weatherbee made his way home with a drink even the stout folk couldn’t handle. This monstrosity is laced with latent magic designed to lessen the chance of drinkers dying from its ungodly alcohol content, and reportedly tastes like “A kick in the face from a horse.” After one shot of this drink, the drinker is shunted into a chaotic haze of blurry awareness, bolstered confidence, and overpowering drunkenness. In addition, the latent magic in the brew causes minor, uncontrolled magical effects to occur around the drinker at random times during the haze. The nature of these effects is up to either the DM or the player, so long as the effects are sufficiently insignificant. After 1d4 hours, the haze drops away and the drinker immediately and almost violently falls into a deep sleep so that they may recover.",
				"Dragonborn Bloodwine – When you drink it, you are able to use a breath attack once within the next 10 minutes.",
				"The Quieker – nasty rum that gives a high pitched voice for 1d4 hours.",

				"The Sun’s Glory – A citrusy cider that makes your eyes glow like an Aasimar.",
				"Black Midnight – A drink created by necromancers to honor fallen necromancers, Bitter with a touch of rum. Those who drink it have nightmares of dying and spending an eternity rotting away inside a coffin. This helps enforce necromancers to contemplate their own moralities.",
				"The Phoenix – A peppery drink that burns on the way down, and then again on the way out. It is often used as a prank on drunk companions, who have a nasty surprise waiting for them the next time they go to relieve themselves.",
				"Hair of the Bloodhound – Once you have become intoxicated on this brew, you gain the usual drawbacks of drunkenness but gain advantage on survival checks.",
				"Seer’s Solution – A mildly viscous green liquid. The first two shots have no effect. The third gives you truesight up to 60ft for 1d4 minutes. The fourth and subsequent shots give the drinker horrible audio/visual hallucinations for 1d4+2 hours. Counter resets at dawn.",

				"The Green Kobold – The first drink to ever be served in a piece of ham, with the skin. 1 shot of herbal liquor wrapped in ham. To be eater all at once. Probably fixed in place with at least 1 pin, make sure you pick it out before you eat it.",
				"End of the Line – Very high quality, rather expensive alcohol. A coin is flipped. If heads, your drink is free. If tails, you are forced to drink until you either die or pass out. If you regain consciousness, you must continue drinking.",

Most refuse to look at it, let alone allow it to come close to their nose. Only those with the strongest will manage to gulp it down. Once drunk, the person experiences true bliss, which seems to last for decades. In reality it’s a few seconds.",
				"Nine Steps – commonly known as ‘The Niner’ or by it’s full name ‘Nine Steps to Hell’. It is a liquid that when left to settle separates into 9 parts, the bottom one being pure black and the top a beautiful red with a gradient in between. After drinking it the person seems frozen for a few seconds, but to the person who gulpes it down it feels like days, weeks, maybe even months of 9 different experiences, all basically a form of torture. Often used as a torture method but sometimes drunk to prove ones mental strenght, as those that can’t endure it go insane. The niner is a rare drink because it’s extremely hard to make. An amateur making it, if the ingridients aren’t correct to the milligram, makes a drink that causes instant death.",
