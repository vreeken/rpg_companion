				"Red Rot – A disease that is contracted by direct contact with a red ooze. The ooze attaches itself to the skin of the person and slowly rots the flesh away at the point of contact.",
				"Gambling Addiction – Will save or compelled to gamble when presented with opportunity.",
				"The Screaming Sickness – The victim moans and screams in their sleep, making it hard for those sleeping near the victim to get a good night’s rest.",
				"Slate Fever – An uncommon sickness that causes skin to become hard and brittle. Originating from the underdark and eventually making its way to the surface, Slate Fever propagates through contact with mosses and fungi contaminated with the disease, as well as through contact with the affected skin of those with the sickness. Early symptoms include a slight grey discoloration of skin tone, uncomfortable stiffness, and unusual amounts of neck and back cracking when moving. The symptoms eventually progress to the point where the diseased becomes noticeably grey and stiff, causing them to move in small, jerk-like motions and have their speed reduced by half. In addition, the diseased develops exceptionally brittle skin that cracks easily and painfully. This gives them vulnerability to bludgeoning damage and causes them to frequently make Constitution saving throws to avoid taking 1d4 damage from shattering parts of their skin with excessive contact. The disease itself usually passes by itself over the course of one week resting and recuperating, but can be cured within 2 days if the diseased is properly treated with a combination of various tree saps. Catching this disease once results in the diseased being more vulnerable to it in the future.",
				"Spectre’s Decay – The victim’s soul and body separate but continue to move in unison. Without a soul the body rapidly degenerates and decays over the course of a year, however wherever the flesh forms holes or rips the ghost of the person continues to stand. This continues until the body has completely decomposed and the ghost is left to wander the earth, unable to pass into an afterlife. This disease can rarely be contracted through contact with undead who have lingering souls.",

To determine when PC vomits, roll a percentile die every 30 minutes in game, If even then vomit, if odd, nothing happens. Vomiting will force the PC to stop what ever action they are doing, and breaks concentration. Vomiting every 3rd time will also cough up blood. Roll 1d4 to calculate damage. The cure is to drink very hard alcohol, and let it dissolve the stomach acid poison. Another option is to survive 10 hours. A lesser restoration spell automatically cures it. Orcs, Half-orcs, and Drow are immune to this.",
				"Transmutation Overload – this can happen if multiple transmutation spells occur on the same time on the same subject or subjects. it deforms the subject to something in the middle of all of them, but also makes the sick immune to transmutation spells, no more room for magic on this body!

On the firstboccurance of a new moon after the incubation period, the infected creature gains 2 more Exhaustion levels. If this kills the creature, it rises again after 1d4-1 nights as a wight. If a blood moon occurs at any point after incubation, the creature instead just succeed in a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die immediately, raising in a minute as a wight. Exhaustion levels gained by this disease reappear every morning and only a miracle, wish or some other similar magic can permanently remove them without curing the disease.",
				"Swordbearer’s Bane – The disease is contracted by contact with an infected creature’s blood. After the incubation period of 1d4 days, the hands and feet of the infected creature begin to swell and become tender. This causes the creature to lose 5ft of movement and imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Slight of hand) checks. After another 7-1d4 days, the infection causes the hosts extremities to go numb.

Finally, a single ‘puff’ quickly grows to the size of a grape and bursts into a small cloud of spores that quickly spread in a breeze, infecting those around the host, as well as leaving a large ‘pockmark’ in it’s place. The fungus, while growing inside the host, causes ever growing feelings of loss and loneliness, pushing the host to seek out more and more companionship. If the fungus is allowed to reach fruition and spore, the sense of loneliness transitions into a permanent and inconsolable state of depression.",
