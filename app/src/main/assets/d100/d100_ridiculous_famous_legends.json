				"One winter it was so cold that the dawn froze solid. The sun normally rose between two mountains, but the ice had built up so much that it stuck firmly in place. The first sunbeams of the day had frozen up like golden icicles. A ranger named Dav Oket was coming home from a successful night hunting with a fresh owlbear. Seeing the sun frozen in place, and being a smart man, Dav knew he had to do something quickly or the world would plunge into chaos. He swiftly sprinted up the frozen sunbeams and used the heat of the owlbear carcass to melt the ice. Dav gave the sun a kick to dislodge it, lit his pipe on the sun, and slid down the sunbeams with the owlbear right to his front door. He even kept a bit of the sunrise in his pocket to remember the occasion.",
				"If you travel to Owlbear Lake on a quiet day, you might just catch a glimpse of The Monster. It looks like a great brown snake 90 feet long, with two huge ears coming out the sides of its head and jaws large enough to swallow a man in one gulp! Some say it has hundreds of small legs that make it kind of skitter across the ground, but it can swim faster than a horse can gallop. Sometimes it sneaks up on swimmers, and if it’s not hungry it just pulls them under and lets them go. Of course old Dav Oket heard about this monster and bet his friends that he could take it on. After days of stalking, Dav finally had a shot with his bow. He was a crack shot, but not an arrow found its mark. The Monster scuttled forward and ate Dav’s bow! So the ranger wrapped his arms around the beast and wrestled with it. The fight was so great, so colossal, that it stirred up a storm over the lake. Finally, Dav threw the Monster over his shoulder, and it sailed right over the mountain. To this day, you can cross the lake in safety if you call out, ‘Old Dav’s a-coming!’ and the Monster swims away to the bottom of the lake.",
